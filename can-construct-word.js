/*
canConstructWordÂ»
Write a function called canConstructWord, which accepts two strings: a word and some letters. The function should return true if the word can be built with the letters that you are given; otherwise, it should return false.

Assume that there are only lowercase letters and no space or special characters in both the word and the letters.

Constraints:

Time Complexity: O(m + n) (if m is the length of word and n is the length of letters)

Examples:

canConstructWord('aa', 'abc')
  // false -- can't build "aa" with only 1 "a"

canConstructWord('abc', 'dcba')
  // true -- can build "abc" with letters "abcd"

canConstructWord('aabbcc', 'bcabcaddff')
  // true -- can build "aabbcc" with those letters
